# hadoop.2.4.1
My own local formula for installing Hadoop 2.4.1 using Homebrew so I can run Apache Spark built for 2.4.1.  It is based on the 2.5 Hadoop Formula. Feel free to use it.

To use this formula use this command:

 brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InvisibleTech/hadoop.2.4.1/master/hadoop24.rb
